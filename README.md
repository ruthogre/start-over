# start-over
Objective: re-learn all programing skills and master them all

I am starting this journey over again!
Two years ago when I graduated from university, I wanted to start learning R so I signed up on Coursera for a class.
After a while, I got occupied with work and stopped learining R completely.
Now, I've determined to re-start this journey, and I am not letting anything to stop me again.
